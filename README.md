# Introduction to IBM's Foundation Models for Materials

Welcome to IBM's series of large foundation models for sustainable materials. Our models span a variety of representations and modalities, including SMILES, SELFIES, atom positions, 3D energy grids, molecular graphs, and other formats. These models are designed to support and advance research in materials science and chemistry.

## Collaboration and Community

We strongly believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven development to propel AI forward. As such, we will be releasing our latest open innovations on this IBM GitHub organization page, with model weights available on our Hugging Face organization. We hope that the AI community will find our efforts useful and that our models will help fuel their research and innovation in the field of materials science.

## Repository Structure

The structure of IBM's materials family of foundation models is organized as follows:

```
materials/
├── smi-ted
├── selfie-ted
├── 3dgrid-vqgan
├── ...  
```

Each folder represents a different chemical representation and architecture type. The repository will be continuously updated with new models, improvements, and additional documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with our models, you can clone the repository and explore the available models. Detailed documentation and example notebooks are provided in each model's folder to help you understand how to use them effectively.

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/materials.git
```

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have any ideas, improvements, or new models you'd like to share, please feel free to contact.
